title: The Crux of the Opioid Crisis

# Itâ€™s clear that there is a huge problem with opioid use in the United States.
## While that is evident, the debate comes when we are discussing the reason for the crisis.Having a healthcare administrator perspective, I am always curious about the "root cause" of issues. I know...I know...data scientists should never speak in absolutes like that. But I believe that when given a great deal of information, we should be able to make reasonable assumptions or projections.
