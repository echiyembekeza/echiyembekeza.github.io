title: Am I understanding?
description: No, really? I think it's clicking.

Well into the first sprint, I was feeling a little uneasy. It was interesting. I felt like I was understanding...but I did not want to be overconfident. I suppose this was already the beginning of the well-known "imposter syndrome". To digress for a moment, I always described the imposter syndrome as having the <i>feeling</i> that you did not "belong" where you were. For some reason, despite having the qualifications, the training, the "chops", or the experience, you still have some discomfort surrounding your being there. But, interestingly, I recently came across a new definition of imposter syndrome that I thought was incredibly profound. Basically, imposter syndrome was described as, "the more you learn, the more you realize you still have to learn." This echos the sentiments of Socrates when he said, "I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I konw nothing."

I am quickly learning, that this will be a constant learning process. There are many ways to arrive at solutions. I think the best way that I can describe this is that I must be rigid enough to appropriately use structures, but open-minded enough to know how to creatively manipulate those structures to do what I want them to do.
